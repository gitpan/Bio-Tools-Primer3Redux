Bio-Tools-Primer3Redux

This is a set of modules for running and parsing Primer3 output using BioPerl.
It is meant as an update for the previous Primer3 perl modules
(Bio::Tools::Primer3 and Bio::Tools::Run::Primer3) to use both Primer3 v1.x and
v2.x (which had significant API changes from v1.x).

However, due to changes in the API of the parser to allow for more informational
storage, these have been renamed to Bio::Tools::Primer3Redux.
